# C4 Relation Creation

## Critical Requirements

- ALWAYS read `likec4/relations.c4` and the relevant blueprint file before creating relations
- Cross-star relations go in `relations.c4`, internal relations go in the blueprint file
- ALWAYS validate with `npm run validate` after changes

## Relation Kinds

| Kind | Syntax | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `syncs` | `-[syncs]->` | Data synchronization |
| `dataSource` | `-[dataSource]->` | Declares where data comes from |
| `produces` | `-[produces]->` | Generates/creates |
| `owns` | `-[owns]->` | Ownership relationship |
| `governs` | `-[governs]->` | Governance/control |
| `dependsOn` | `-[dependsOn]->` | Dependency |
| `includes` | `-[includes]->` | Containment |
| `triggers` | `-[triggers]->` | Initiates an action |
| `deploys` | `-[deploys]->` | Deployment |
| `authenticates` | `-[authenticates]->` | Authentication |

## Where Relations Go

### In blueprint files (`blueprints/*.c4`)

- Relations between blueprints **within the same star**
- `dataSource` relations from blueprint to integration

### In `relations.c4`

- **Actor → Capability** relations (with `navigateTo`)
- **Integration ↔ External System** syncs
- **Integration → Blueprint** syncs
- **Cross-star** blueprint relations
- **Capability → Capability** dependencies

## Full Path Requirements

All elements in `relations.c4` MUST use full paths:

```c4
// Correct
idp.starVCS.repository -[dependsOn]-> idp.starCatalog.technologyAsset 'linked to asset'

// Wrong
repository -[dependsOn]-> technologyAsset 'linked to asset'
```

## Tags

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `#sync` | Data synchronization |
| `#ownership` | Ownership semantics |
| `#dataFlow` | Data movement |
| `#governance` | Governance/control |

## Bidirectional DataSource Pattern

Every blueprint MUST have a bidirectional data source connection:

```
Blueprint ---[dataSource]---> Integration ---[syncs]---> External System
```

In the blueprint file:
```c4
repository -[dataSource]-> idp.integrationLayer.intGitHub 'synced from GitHub' { #sync }
```

In relations.c4:
```c4
idp.integrationLayer.intGitHub -[syncs]-> idp.starVCS.repository 'syncs repo data' { #sync }
```

## Common Patterns

### Star-to-Actor
```c4
idp.starCatalog -> developer 'provides service discovery' {
  navigateTo developerSelfService
}
```

### Blueprint-to-Blueprint (Cross-Star)
```c4
idp.starCICD.deployment -[deploys]-> idp.starResource.resource 'deploys to' { #dataFlow }
```

### Governance Relations
```c4
idp.starGRC.policy -[governs]-> idp.starCatalog.technologyAsset 'governs asset' { #governance }
```

### Ownership Relations
```c4
idp.starOrganization._team -[owns]-> idp.starCatalog.technologyAsset 'owns asset' { #ownership }
```

## Workflow

1. **Read** `likec4/relations.c4`
2. **Read** relevant blueprint file(s)
3. **Determine** correct file for the relation
4. **Add** relation with correct kind, path, and tags
5. **Validate** with `npm run validate`
