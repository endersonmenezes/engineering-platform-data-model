# C4 Persona Creation

## Critical Requirements

- ALWAYS read `likec4/model.c4` and `likec4/relations.c4` before creating or editing personas
- Personas require changes in 3+ files — follow ALL steps
- ALWAYS validate with `npm run validate` after changes

## Overview

Personas (actors) represent the different types of users who interact with the Internal Developer Portal. Each persona has specific capabilities they access and specific workflows (journeys) they follow.

## Current Personas

| Persona | Variable | Primary Stars |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| Application Developer | `developer` | starTemplates, starCatalog, starVCS, starCICD, starArtifacts |
| Platform Engineer | `platformEngineer` | starTemplates, integrationLayer, starResource, starCICD |
| Tech Lead | `techLead` | starMetrics, starQuality, starOrganization, starGRC, starCatalog |
| Security Engineer | `securityEngineer` | starSecurity, starGRC, starCatalog |

## Persona Structure in model.c4

Personas are defined at the top level of the model, outside the `idp` system:

```c4
model {

  developer = actor 'Developer' {
    description 'Software engineer who uses the portal for daily development workflows'
    style {
      shape person
      color amber
    }
  }

  idp = system 'Internal Developer Portal' { ... }
}
```

## Complete Steps to Create a New Persona

### Step 1: Define the actor in `model.c4`

```c4
model {
  qaEngineer = actor 'QA Engineer' {
    description 'Quality assurance engineer who validates releases and manages test environments'
    style {
      shape person
      color amber
    }
  }
}
```

**Rules:**
- Variable name: `camelCase` (e.g., `qaEngineer`)
- Kind: `actor`
- Style: `shape person`, `color amber` (consistent with other personas)
- Must have `description`

### Step 2: Add capability relations in `relations.c4`

```c4
// QA Engineer → Capabilities
idp.starQuality -> qaEngineer 'provides quality dashboards' {
  navigateTo qaEngineerQualityReview
}
idp.starCICD -> qaEngineer 'provides pipeline visibility' {
  navigateTo qaEngineerTestExecution
}
```

**Relation Pattern:**
- Direction: `idp.star* -> persona` (star provides value TO persona)
- Include `navigateTo` referencing the dynamic view ID
- Each relation represents a primary interaction

### Step 3: Create journey views in `views/journeys.c4`

Create at least one dynamic view for the persona:

```c4
dynamic view qaEngineerQualityReview {
  title 'QA Engineer: Quality Review'
  description 'QA Engineer reviews quality gates and test coverage for a service'

  qaEngineer -> idp 'navigates to Developer Portal' {
    notes 'QA Engineer accesses the portal to review quality metrics'
  }
  idp -> idp.starCatalog 'browses service catalog' {
    notes 'Finds the service to review'
  }
  idp.starCatalog -> idp.starQuality 'checks quality metrics' {
    notes 'Reviews code quality, test coverage, and quality gates'
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Validate

```bash
npm run validate
npm test
```

## Checklist for New Persona

- [ ] At least 2-3 capability relations in `relations.c4`
- [ ] Each relation has `navigateTo` pointing to a journey view
- [ ] At least 1 dynamic journey view in `views/journeys.c4`
- [ ] Appears in C1 landscape view
- [ ] `npm run validate` passes
- [ ] `npm test` passes
